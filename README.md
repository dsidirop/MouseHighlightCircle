# MouseHighlightCircle - Turtle WoW Addon

MouseHighlightCircle is a lightweight addon designed for Turtle WoW (Vanilla WoW 1.12.1-based server) to enhance mouse cursor visibility. It adds a pixelated white ring around your mouse cursor with a transparent center, making it easier to track your cursor during chaotic moments like raids or PvP battles. This addon is perfect for players who want to reduce cursor confusion without relying on modern addons like WeakAuras (which are not supported in Turtle WoW).

## Features
- Adds a pixelated white ring around the mouse cursor (retro Vanilla WoW aesthetic).
- Transparent center for a clean and unobtrusive look.
- Follows the mouse cursor smoothly in real-time.
- Lightweight and optimized for Turtle WoW‚Äôs 1.12.1 client.
- Slash commands for easy control:
  - `/mhc show` - Show the cursor ring.
  - `/mhc hide` - Hide the cursor ring.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/goamania/MouseHighlightCircle/releases) page.
2. Extract the `MouseHighlightCircle` folder into your `World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/` directory.
3. Ensure the `pixelring.tga` texture file is included in the addon folder (required for the ring effect).
4. Launch Turtle WoW, enable the addon in the AddOns menu, and log in.
5. Use `/mhc show` in-game to display the cursor ring.

## Texture Information
The addon uses a single TGA texture (`pixelring.tga`) for the pixelated white ring. This texture must be a 64x64 pixel image with a transparent center and a white, pixelated border. If you need to customize the ring‚Äôs appearance, you can replace the `pixelring.tga` file with your own design (maintain the same dimensions and transparency).

## Compatibility
- Designed for Turtle WoW (Vanilla WoW 1.12.1 client).
- May work on other 1.12.1-based servers, but only tested on Turtle WoW.
